# Machine_Learning-
This repository contains the basic contents of ML and It's practical's. 

Machine learning is the practice of teaching a computer to learn. The concept uses pattern recognition, as well as other forms of predictive algorithms, to make judgments on incoming data. This field is closely related to artificial intelligence and computational statistics.
Datasets for the models are provided at ML_datas
